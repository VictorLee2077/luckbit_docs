This Privacy Policy applies to the Luckbit Wallet browser extension ("the Extension"). The Extension is a non-custodial wallet. Private keys are encrypted and stored locally. We do not custody or access your private keys or assets.

## 1. Information We Collect
We **do not collect, store, or sell** any personally identifiable information.  
No account or login is required to use core features.

## 2. Local Data Storage
To provide wallet functionality, the Extension stores the following data **locally on your device** (not uploaded):
- Encrypted private keys / seed phrases
- Account and network configuration
- Token information and transaction cache
- User settings (language, auto-lock, etc.)

All sensitive data is encrypted locally. The Extension cannot read your private keys or seed phrases in plaintext.

## 3. Communication with Third Parties
To query blockchain data or broadcast transactions, the Extension communicates with blockchain nodes and block explorers. These requests may include:
- Wallet addresses
- Transaction hashes
- Network and chain IDs
- Your device IP address (as part of normal network requests)

This communication is only for providing wallet functionality. We **do not** share or sell your data to third parties.

## 4. Permission Disclosure (Privacy-Related)
- `storage` / `unlimitedStorage`: Store wallet data and settings locally
- `tabs` / `activeTab`: Interact with the current DApp page, authorize connections, open required pages
- `alarms`: Auto-lock timer
- `<all_urls>` host permission: Inject Provider and handle authorization on any DApp site

## 5. Data Security
We use local encryption and auto-lock mechanisms to protect your data. Please keep your seed phrase and password safe; lost credentials cannot be recovered.

## 6. Data Deletion
You can reset the wallet or clear extension data to remove all local data. This action is irreversible. Please back up your seed phrase in advance.
